# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Selenium test case design process
Prior to initiating testing procedures, we conducted a thorough examination of the provided websites. We explored different functionalities of these websites. With a careful observation and exploration, we choose [Shop Smart Canada](https://shopsmartcanada.com/) as our System Under Test (SUT). Our rationale for selecting this particular website is as follows:

1. By the look of the website, we could tell it is an old website having potential existence of bugs making it a perfect test subject.
2. The website is built using PHP and follows a multi-page structure which makes it easier to imitate user interactions.
3. Additionally, we observed that other websites like [Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.ca/) dynamically generate DOM element IDs, rendering it more challenging to intercept the desired targets using Selenium.

With the SUT chosen, we compiled a list of functionalities to be tested or automated using Selenium IDE. Our emphasis was on the most frequently used features of the website. The outlined features are as follows:

- Login
- Searching with different queries
- Add or remove addresses
- Sorting products with different criteria
- Updating account information
- Adding or removing items from cart
- Creating and deleting wish list
- Adding or removing items from wish list
- Newsletter subscription

After defining the scenarios or functionalities, we created several test cases for each of the functionalities to be tested and analyze if they work as expected. For example, we expect a user can login with valid credentials but can not with an invalid one.

As the website requires authentication for different actions to be performed, we also created a test account with the following credentials and used it as required:
```
Email: vzz3wv0uf4@lettershield.com
Password: testPassword123
```
# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
In Selenium, assertions and checkpoints are essential for validating the behavior and the state of web elements or pages during test execution. We assert in different checkpoints to make sure everything is working as expected.

**Assertions:**
Assertions are statements that verify whether a certain condition is true or false. For example, we might assert that a certain element is present, has a specific text, or is enabled/disabled. If the assertion fails during test execution, it indicates a discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior. Quoting the Selenium documentation, there are 3 types of assertions.

>  **Assert:** If it fails, the test is stopped immediately.<br> **Verify:** If it fails, Selenium IDE logs this failure and continues with the test execution.<br>**WaitFor:** waitFor commands will first wait for a certain condition to become true.

In our testing, we used all of the assertion types.

**Checkpoints:**
Checkpoints are similar to assertions but often they are used to ensure that specific criteria are met at a particular point during test execution. For instance, you might use a checkpoint to verify the contents of a table, the presence of multiple elements on a page, or the state of a dynamic user interface component. If any of the checkpoint conditions are not met, the test execution may fail, indicating a deviation from the expected behavior.

A few examples are provided below from our generated test cases:

|Test functionality|Example of checkpoints|
|---------|----------------------|
|Login_Valid_Credentials|Asserts to the change in the header upon login or the alert message on incorrect credentials.|
|Login_Invalid_Credentials|Asserts to the alert message on incorrect credentials.|
|Account_Settings_Update_Phone_Number_Valid|Asserts text to verify if the setting is actually updated.|
|Account_Settings_Update_Phone_Number_Invalid|Asserts text to verify if the setting is actually updated.|
|Address_Valid_Data|Asserts to the new address title.|
|Address_Invalid_Data|Verifies the behaviour of the SUT whether it updates with invalid data or not.|
|Search_With_Valid_Query|Verifies the content on the page on valid search query|
|Search_With_Valid_Query|Asserts to "0 results for {query}" on invalid query.|
|Cart_Add_Item|Asserts to "Your Cart" when adding an item.|
|Cart_Remove_Item|Verifies to the text label "Your cart is empty" when everything is deleted from cart.|
|Newsletter_Subscribe_Valid|Upon subscription, asserts the confirmation text.|
|Newsletter_Subscribe_Invalid|Upon subscription attempt, asserts the error message.|
|Wish_List_Create_New_List|Asserts to list name when creation.|
|Wish_List_Delete_All_List|Asserts to text "You have no Wish Lists, add one now." when deleting all lists.| 
|Wish_List_Add_Item|Asserts to list name and waits for the added item to show up in the list.|
|Wish_List_Remove_Item|On item removal, also verifies the text - "Your Wish List is empty. When you add items to your Wish List they will appear here."|

Almost all functionalities under test also uses logout on which the test asserts or verifies to the text "You've been logged out of your account successfully."
# Testing functionality with different data
Whenever possible, or the test case allowed, we tested each test cases with different data. Our test cases also managed to found some existing bugs in the system. A brief table is provided with the different types of test data used.

|Test case|Test data/command|Expected|Actual|Decision|
|---------|---------|--------|------|--------|
|Login|Tested with valid credentials|Should log in|Logged in|Pass|
||Tested with invalid credentials|Should not log in and an error alert should be shown|Did not log in and an alert was shown|Pass|
|Account Settings - Update Phone Number|Valid phone number|Should update the number|Updated the number|Pass|
||Invalid phone number|Should not update the number|Updated the number|**Bug detected**|
|Search|Valid query item|Should show a list of items matching the query|Shows a list of query items|Pass|
||Invalid query item|Should not show any item but a zero response|Does not show any item but ") results"|Pass|
|Address - Add New Address|A valid Alberta address is provided|Should add the address|Added the address|Pass|
||An invalid address is provided|Should not add the address rather show an error message|Added the address|**Bug detected**|
|Cart|Add item to the cart|Should add the item to the cart|Added the item to the cart|Pass|
||Remove item from the cart|Should remove the item to the cart|Removed the item to the cart|Pass|
|Wish List - Creation/Deletion|Provide a wish list name to create|Should create a new wish list by the provided name|Creates the wish list|Pass|
||Remove an existing wish list|Should remove the wish list by the provided name|Removes the wish list|Pass|
|Wish List - Add/Remove Item|Add an item to a wish list|Should add the item to the wish list|Adds the item to the list|Pass|
||Remove an existing item from wish list|Should remove the item from the list|Removes the item from the list|Pass|
|Sort|Use alphabetical sorting|Should sort the items alphabetically|Sorts the item alphabetically|Pass|
||Use price-based sorting|Should sort the items by their price|Sorts the item by price|Pass|
||Use best-selling sorting|Should sort the items based on best selling|Sorts the item as expected|Pass|
||Use review-based sorting|Should sort the items based on reviews|No change is reflected in UI|**Bug detected**|
|Newsletter - Subscription|Use a valid email to subscribe|A confirmation message should be shown|Shows a confirmation message|Pass|
||Use an invalid email to subscribe|An error message should be shown|Shows an error message|Pass|

Although not expected but we were able to find a few bugs in the system. Additionally, we also believe the website is lacking some crucial features. For example, the website only provides an interface to subscribe to their newsletter but doesn't provide an option to unsubscribe.
